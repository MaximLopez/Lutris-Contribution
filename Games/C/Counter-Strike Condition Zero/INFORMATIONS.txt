Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a reworked version of Counter-Strike with the addition of all-new multiplayer maps and high-detail player and weapon models.

It includes the Tour of Duty mode, a series of Counter-Strike matches against computer-controlled opponents using the official CS bot to simulate multiplayer games offline with bots or take the bots online for added competition. There is a collection of Deleted Scenes, 18 story-driven missions that were developed by Ritual Entertainment but eventually left out with the final release of the game.

The Linux and Macintosh version were never available separately. When they were released, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero could only be bought as a compilation pack containing both Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and the original Half-Life: Counter-Strike. However, existing players who only owned Counter-Strike: Condition Zero thus received it for the additional platforms for free, even if they did not own the original Half-Life: Counter-Strike or never bought the compilation pack.

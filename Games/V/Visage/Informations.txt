Visage is an independent survival horror video game by SadSquare Studio. The game is a spiritual successor to P.T. The game ran Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight campaigns.

Visage is set inside a large house in which terrible things have happened. Players will have to relive fragments of the house's history, each of them bringing the player closer to what is behind the dark history of the place by witnessing firsthand the "visage" each death left behind. The game is planned to be split into four chapters. As of July 2019, the first two have been released as part of the game's early access period.

Players roam the house in a first person perspective, able to manipulate objects and doors and must manage limited resources such as lighter fluid and spare light bulbs as they explore the home trying to discover the truth. Locked doors and the keys that fit them form a central part of progression through the game. The house is designed as a semi-open world, with large sections freely explorable to the player, including areas not relevant to the current chapter. Ghosts will create paranormal events by manipulating the house as the player explores, sometimes in scripted events, sometimes as randomized events such as light bulbs burning out or doors locking.

There are three ways to die: being killed by environmental hazards, being killed by the various ghosts and demons that inhabit the home, or losing one's sanity. Sanity, like similar systems in games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent is decreased by witnessing enemies or paranormal events and gradually over time by staying in the darkness. The lower the player's sanity gets, the more of a foothold the ghosts have in the house and the more the player will encounter random paranormal events or hostile ghosts. Sanity can be restored by taking pills which are scattered throughout the house, or by staying in well lit areas. The game doesn't feature a health meter, so being caught results in an instant death.
